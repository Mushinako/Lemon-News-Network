# Python Price Skyrocket after Elon Musk Indicated He Will Switch All Company Code to Python

After Elon Musk announced on Twitter that all code used in SpaceX's rocket and Tesla vehicles will
be rewritten in Python, the sale price of pythons has risen over fivefold across the United States.

The Lemon News Network has reached out to multiple pet shops across Florida, all of whom confirmed
the increased demand for all species of pythons in the last two days. With the depletion of python
stocks across the nation imminent, customers have also expressed interest in purchasing other
families of snakes, including vipers and boas.

While some critics have expressed concern against mass python adoption, pointing out their
predating nature and comparably slow speed, many customers seem unphased by these warnings. Mike
Bart, a resident of Miami, Florida, told the Lemon News Network that he chose to purchase an
Indian python and has been happy with his purchase. "I like how pythons talk," said Mike as his
python slowly wraps around his waist, "they just say 'Hssss'. How simple and English-like is that?"
Mike has also told reporters that his former pet parrot has been missing since the introduction of
the python, about which he was not concerned. "Frankly, this might be my ideal pet."
