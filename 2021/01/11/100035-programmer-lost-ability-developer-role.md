# Programmer Lost All Ability to Code after "Developer" Role Was Removed from His Account in Python Discord

"It was just like any other day before I opened Discord." Local programmer Mike Bart told Lemon
News Network reporter, "I went to Python Discord server, clicked on my profile picture to admire
my 'Developer' role, but... it wasn't there anymore. At that instant, I knew I was doomed." Mr.
Bart immediately lost all coding-related abilities, including managing an unnecessarily colorful
and translucent terminal emulator, dragging windows from one monitor to another, and no feeling
nausea when the RGB lighting on the keyboard starts to change color.

Mr. Bart's physician, Dr. Mike Bart, told the Lemon News Network that Mr. Bart is currently
undergoing rehabilitation. "Mr. Bart is making good progress through the three-year program.
Currently, we're reteaching him how to press the buttons on the keyboard with just the right force
to make the same letter pop up on the screen. After a year, he'll start to remember how to make
Google searches to find the YouTube video that talks about how to learn Python in 100 seconds."

Mr. Bart expressed gratitude to both of those who helped them during these difficult times, and
indicated that he will send both of them thank-you emails once he regains the know-how in 15
months.
