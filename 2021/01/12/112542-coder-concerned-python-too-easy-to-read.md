# Local Coder Concerned Python Too Easy to Read

Local area coder Mike Bart has voiced his concern to Lemon News Network reporter on Tuesday that
Python feels too easy to read, which poorly reflects the fact that whatever he codes is cool and
advanced. "Y'know, it's basically English and a few common math symbols. Any ten-year-old knows
what I'm typing, and that isn't hip at all."

Mr. Bart also criticized many design choices adopted by the Python language and community. "All the
keywords should become symbols. `if` should be the branching symbol; `for` should be the repeat
symbol; `return` should be that emoji about passing stuff between people." Mr. Bart has submitted
various PEP proposals, including requiring all characters to be typed with a compose key and all
script written in top-to-bottom, right-to-left. Mr. Bart has also submitted requests to the Unicode
Consortium for more programming-related symbols and emojis, including one where a person tries to
debug 237 errors at 4:52 A.M. after having 6 cups of coffee.
